# SVM Classification Task

This project demonstrates the use of Support Vector Machines for binary classification using both linear and RBF kernels.

## Dataset
Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset from scikit-learn

## Key Steps
1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Training SVM with linear and RBF kernels
3. Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
4. Visualization of decision boundaries (on 2D data)
5. Performance evaluation using cross-validation

## How to Run
1. Install required packages: `pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn`
2. Run the script: `python svm_task.py`
